# LangChain User Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the LangChain user manual! LangChain is a software library that allows you to build applications using large language models (LLMs) through composability. With LangChain, you can seamlessly integrate LLMs with other sources of computation or knowledge to create powerful and innovative applications.

This manual will guide you through the installation process, introduce you to the main functions of the software, and provide examples on how to use it effectively.

## Installation

To install LangChain, you can use either pip or conda. Open your terminal and run one of the following commands:

```
pip install langchain
```

or

```
conda install langchain -c conda-forge
```

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed in your environment before proceeding.

## Main Functions

LangChain provides several main functions that you can use to build your applications. Here are the key functions:

1. **Question Answering over specific documents**: This function allows you to perform question-answering tasks over specific documents. You can provide a document and a question, and LangChain will generate the answer based on the document content.

2. **Agents**: The agents function enables you to create intelligent agents that can interact with users and provide information or perform tasks. You can combine LLMs with other sources of knowledge, such as WolframAlpha, to create powerful agents.

## Examples

To help you get started, here are some examples of how to use LangChain effectively:

1. **Question Answering over Notion Database**: In this example, you will learn how to use LangChain to perform question-answering tasks over a Notion database. You will provide a question and LangChain will search the database for relevant information and generate the answer.

2. **GPT+WolframAlpha**: This example demonstrates how to create an intelligent agent using LangChain. The agent combines the power of GPT with the knowledge of WolframAlpha to provide accurate and informative responses to user queries.
